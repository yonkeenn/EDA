# How I explore data before modeling

The main idea for doing exploration is to get insights we can use later during featuring, modeling, dashboard creation, etc. I think EDA has been discussed from many different approaches. Here I’m trying to focus exploration from my point of view.

There are many ways to tackle this task. From my point of view, we need to have the basic knowledge of the field. It’s a must. The aim is to discover underlying patterns for further analysis or decision-making or model training.

I separate in 4 layers. First is "Data Understanding", I mean study the subject this data came from. Then we have to do a "High Level" review to discover basic information like null values, duplicated and so on. Later we can start to do data analysis for whether "Univariate Analysis" and "Multivariate Analysis". And which tool or technique use depends on your experience. The limit is our curiosity to explore our data!.
